# Question 01
#	How long did you spend on this assignment? What would you have done different if you had more time?

Ans => Spend 2 hours and completed Add User and Save on Runtime, Delete User and Read Data from Json. As I can't able to complete search and Validation in 2 hours if there were more time then I will complete these remaining things, Search taken most of my time becasue I didn't done this job before to read data from local json and apply serach filter on in it. I will share my last week work repo in which in I did the same search filter job on demo APIa nd if there were more time i will try it in another way.   

# Question 01
#	What are focus areas if your code would have to be part of an actual application? 

#	Ans => I tried the best way to read data then add user and if it were the part of actual application then reading json with Http and adding user will be focus areas.
